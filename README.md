# Rainbow-animation

Made a rainbow animation with plain CSS and HTML. Main goal was to practice animations.

# Demo

<div style="width:360px;max-width:100%;"><div style="height:0;padding-bottom:46.11%;position:relative;"><iframe width="360" height="166" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameBorder="0" src="https://imgflip.com/embed/47ec51"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://imgflip.com/gif/47ec51"></a></p></div>

# Technologies Used

HTML, Plain CSS

# Problems

Making the rainbow as an unordered list was problematic. It was tricky to figure it out.
